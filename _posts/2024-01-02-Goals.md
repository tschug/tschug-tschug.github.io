It's that time of the year---new year's resolutions are abound and I want to give you one to add to the list.  Let's set a goal for goal-setting.

- [ ] New Year's Resolutions
  - [x] ~~Decide to set resoulutions~~
  - [x] Learn about goal setting
  - [ ] Write goals
  - [ ] Goal 1 ...

Sure, many of us will set some targets to reach; some may be low, others may be stretch, and still others will be unrealistic.  

And then what happens?  A sense of unfulfilment or disappointment  when they are not accomplished or maybe even ambivalence as we forget these goals even existed.

So let's focus on better goal-setting, for ourselves and our organizations.

## SMART Goals

Most of us have heard of ***SMART*** goals, but for those who have not, here's a quick refresher:

S
: Specific - providing sufficient detail to the focus

M
: Measurable - giving more detail by putting a number to target

A
: Achievable/Attainable - making sure that it is realistic and within capacity, albeit requiring a stretch to make it happen

R
: Relevant - setting out on an effort that will have an impact and provide value that is wanted or needed

T
: Timely/Timebound - setting the deadline to try and achieve by

I've always struggled with some of these and was happy to have found people added to them in the past to make them ***SMARTER***

E
: Evaluable - making sure that the measurable M can actually be assessed at points leading up to our timely T

R
: Revisable/Re-adjustable- preparing ourselves for the unknown by giving ourselves permission before we start that the goal can changed under the circumstances rather than dropping it

> The last one has always been a struggle to get my peers to understand.
>
> It's not setting the expectation that you will fail, but it's allowing forgiveness and second chances when life, outside of your control, prevents a goal from being met. Rather than beating yourself up for failing a goal or being able to toss the goal in the garbage when it can no longer be met, this challenges us to keep working towards it even though we know we will fall short.

ðŸ’­ I believe the steps to a ***SMART*** goal could be classified as qualitative "Left-Brained" goals. They are often logical with a focus on analytics, often linear/sequential, based on facts.  They can come off as cold and calculated.

## CLEAR Goals

But what about the other side, are there goals for the qualitative "Right-Brained" side?

Let's take a look at ***CLEAR*** goals:

C
: Collaborative - items which encourage teams and team members to work together or be interdisciplinary

L
: Limited - keeping the scope and duration in check

E
: Emotional - connecting to the team members that have to work on them or are impacted by the goal by bringing energy and passion

A
: Appreciable - no, not the emotional appreciation (that's covered by **`E`**) but the over-time appreciation meaning they are a part of bigger initiatives/missions or can be broken down further into sub-goals for quicker, easier small wins

R
: Refinable - allowing revisions and modifications for the unexpected

> Now, nothing stopping us from adding the same **`ER`**, other than _Revisable_ and _Refinable_ would overlap. However, we can clearly (pun intended) see the only overlap of the originals is _Specific_ and _Limited_.
{: .prompt-tip }

What's fun over here on the "Right-Brained" side of creativity and emotions are the opportunities the different areas opened up to the traditional goal setting.  They offer a more warm and inviting approach for the team.

- _Collaborative_ brings with it the added benefit of group accountability and strengthening interconnectedness.
- _Emotional_ brings that internal driver which overtime develops into that _Appreciable_ undertone.

## Both/And

Which one should you go with? There's a time and a place for picking one over the other, but **consider BOTH!**

**Both** left- **and** right-brained, ***SMART*** **and** ***CLEAR*** goals can work together to compliment the direction of your life or your organization.

Using a both/and approach means being able to honor the full complicated reality that life presents.  We can feel both the need for structure and for compassion, so let's respect those feelings by stiving to address both.  Let's set goals that we can track with key performance indicators, while also making sure they have a place close to our hearts.  And regardless of which goal-setting approach we take, there's on thing to remember---to give ourselves permission ahead of time to make appropriate and necessary changes in respond to life's curveballs.
