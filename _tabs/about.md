## Shifting Your Org Towards Success

FixYour.Org is also known as Dog Leg Solutions. The company name is a play on words full of symbolism, something Tim finds imporant in life.  The name honors one of Tim's cherished dogs, Charlie, who had a birth defect requiring an amputation when he was just 3-months old. Charlie was a daily inspiration to many since this challenge did not phase him and he was able to live a full life upto his 13th year. At the same time, the name also a pivotal racing concept.

> The term __dog leg__ comes from the manual giftshift design perferred by early racecar drivers.  Dog leg gearbox layouts were designed with a distinguished pattern with an up-over-up shift between first and second gear.  In road racing, more frequent shifting occurs from second to third rather than from first to second gear.  The dog-leg gearbox puts second and third gear opposite one another, for a very quick up-shifting or down-shifting motion. This could bring the driver a great speed range with only one quick shift, which was particularly suitable for hill climbing.

## Develop Your Path to Greatness

Our approach to helping your acceleration towards the finish line applies these exact qualities.  With the same focus on performance benefits, we will work alongside you as you navigate the turns.  We will also acknowledge the challenges and obscatcles faced along the way by focusing on what we can achieve through strength and ability, not being heldback by weaknesses.

To do this, weâ€™ll help slow down upon starting, getting to know the intended course ahead, and be ready for the change of direction---focusing and preparing for a smooth transition then accelerating out of the turn.  By slowing down before taking that turn, we can eliminate the jolts to the overall system or losing traction which would disrupt forward movement.  This results in personal and professional changes crossing the finish line with a successful performance.
