## Shifting Your Org Towards Success

> FixYour.Org is also known as Dog Leg Solutions.
>
> The term __dog leg__ comes from the manueal giftshift design perferred by early racecar drivers.  Dog leg gearbox layouts were designed with a distinguished pattern with an up-over-up shift between first and second gear.  In road racing more frequent shifting occurs from second to third than from first to second gear, the dog-leg gearbox puts second and third gear opposite one another, for a very quick up-shifting or down-shifting. This could bring the driver a great speed range with only one shift, which was particularly suitable for hill climbing.
